====== Bill of Materials ======

[[projects:jimbob:bob|$$Bob]]

===== Power =====

Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA or AAA - purchased

Battery Box AA or AAA, 2, 3 or 4 cells - various options purchased

===== Photos Camera =====

== Canon Power Shot A810 ==

[[http://www.dpreview.com/products/canon/compacts/canon_a810|DP Review]] - Purchased

  * 28mm wide angle (wider than most)
  * 2 x AA Batteries
  * 171g inc Batteries, before weight reduction program :)

== Camera mount options ==

  * Nylon threaded rod - [[http://blog.jgc.org/2011/02/gaga-1-voiding-warranty-for-great.html]]
  * Mounting inside a polystyrene ball - 1 hollow ball, 1 sold ball carved out.

== Canon CHDK ==

The Cannon Cameras can be controlled by a firmware extension called CHDK

  * [[http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/A810|CHDK]]

The FAQ entry [[http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ#Q._How_can_I_get_the_original_firmware_version_number_of_my_camera.3F|here]] to get the firmware version wouldn't work for me, so I took a picture and downloaded a program to extract it from the exif info (1.00D).

I then downloaded [[http://mighty-hoernsche.de/bins/a810-100d-1.1.0-2201-full_ALPHA.zip]] from [[http://mighty-hoernsche.de/|http://mighty-hoernsche.de/]] and installed it on a Bootable SD card using the method described [[http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/Prepare_your_SD_card|here]].

Finally I downloaded the example script for HAB use from here: [[http://blog.jgc.org/2010/09/gaga-1-2766-tedious-photographs-and-log.html]].

===== Video Camera =====

Mini DVR 808 #16 V2 -Lens D Car Key Chain Micro Camera - Purchased, in the post.



===== Balloon =====

Looking at using a 500g balloon, requiring 1.29 cu m of Helium.  Purchased from [[http://www.randomengineering.co.uk/Random_Aerospace/Balloons.html|Random Engineering]].

Detailed data is here:  [[guides:balloon_data]]


===== Enclosure =====

Poly Box / Poly Balls?


===== Helium =====

2 options I am considering:

  * http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/320985242876 - No rolling rental charges, but needs collection from Kidsgrove
  * http://balloonhelium.co.uk/main/pricing - Local collection, but rental charges if kept for more than 1 month.

== Cylinder Valve ==

Normal balloon filling valves are not ideal for our use.  Looking for one that has a tap and can have a pipe attached.

== Balloon Filling Device ==

Need to make a hose pipe attached to a waste pipe type fitting, ie:  [[guides:fill_tube]]

===== Parachute =====

Sizing chart here - [[guides:parachute_sizing_chart]]

The [[guides:balloon_data]] 'keep it simple' table suggests 18" or 24".

The drag formula reconed about 30" 

One option for Chutes is here: http://www.randomengineering.co.uk/Random_Aerospace/Parachutes.html, I went direct to https://spherachutes.storesecured.com/.


===== Cord =====



====== Weight ======

Starting to think about the weight of the payload:

GPS Tracker: 

Batteries:  14.5g per AA, 7.6g per AAA

Video Cam: Mini DVR 808 #16 17g

Photos Cam:  100 to 200g


Total could be : 60g AA, 40g Tracker?, 17g #16 Video Cam, 150g photos cam, 20g packing = 300g


====== Testing ======
